            <p>I'm Cait Sidener and I am a full-stack web developer. I graduated from the University of Washburn with my BA in
                French, and earned my teaching licensure with an additional endorsement in English. For five years, I taught
                both languages in the public schools of Kansas (and one year in Virginia). Learning language has always been
                my passion, and helping others learn how to communicate is one of my strengths.</p>
            <p>I am the proud mother of an incredibly strong-willed little girl. My husband and I live in Lawrence, Kansas, where
                we love working on home-improvement projects, hiking around Clinton Lake, and enjoying the infrequent date night
                sampling delicious foods that our town has to offer. Over the course of my child's life, I have become an
                expert baby wearer, made up an entirely new language called "Baby Babble," learned what to do when there is a
                diaper explosion (call her dada), and cherished every snuggle and cuddle party. </p>
            <p>In my former life as an educator, I learned how to affectively communicate with colleagues to build a curriculum
                from scratch. These days, I put those skills to use collaborating with other web developer to build clean code.
                I made this major career switch, because I am passionate about my work as a full-stack developer. I am always
                challenged to discover something new, and truly love using my skills to solve a problem. </p>
